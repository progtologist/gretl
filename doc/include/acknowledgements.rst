=========================

First of all, thanks to Ramu Ramanathan, Professor Emeritus of the University of California, San Diego, for open-sourcing his "ESL" econometric code, which was the starting point for the development of gretl. Professor Ramanathan is author of `Introductory Econometrics <http://econ.ucsd.edu/~rramanat/embook5.htm>`_ (Dryden, currently in its 5th edition). Ramu has also been a very helpful critic over the course of gretl's development.

Many people have sent in useful bug reports and suggestions for gretl's development. We are particularly indebted to Ignacio Díaz-Emparanza, Tadeusz Kufel, Pawel Kufel, Dirk Eddelbuettel, Sven Schreiber and Andreas Rosenblad. A. Talha Yalta plays a helpful role in scrutinizing and reporting on gretl's numerical accuracy.

Many thanks to Ignacio Díaz-Emparanza, Susan Orbe, Michel Robitaille, Florent Bresson, Cristian Rigamonti, Tadeusz and Pawel Kufel, Markus Hahn, Sven Schreiber, Hélio Guilherme, Henrique Andrade, Alexander Gedranovich, Talha Yalta, Y. N. Yang, Pavla Nikolovova, Jan Hanousek, Artur Bala, Manolis Tzagarakis and Ioannis Venetis for their work in translating gretl.

Thanks to William Greene, author of Econometric Analysis, for his permission to include in the gretl package some datasets relating to interesting examples in his text.

Thanks to the good people on comp.lang.c and `gtk-app-devel-list@gnome.org <gtk-app-devel-list@gnome.org>`_ for expert advice on many issues. Thanks to Richard Stallman of the Free Software Foundation for all his work in developing and promoting free software, and more specifically for agreeing to "adopt" gretl as a GNU program.
