This directory contains materials for building the win32 version of
gretl.  The resources should work both for cross-compilation on
Linux, using the mingw32 cross-compiler, and for a "native" build on 
MS Windows, using mingw plus msys (see mingw.org). 

For additional resources (discussed below), see

http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

If you want to build gretl for win32 yourself you will need to get
some additional files, and will probably need to modify some of the 
settings in the Makefiles and scripts to suit your own setup.

A. Additional files:

1. GTK+ for win32 (with iconv and libintl): glib version 2.0 and also
   gdk/gtk version 2.0.  See http://www.gtk.org/download-windows.html .

2. libxml, libreadline, libpng, zlib and gmp

   For all of the above, you need DLLs, import libraries (.a) and
   headers.  See 

   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/
   http://mingwrep.sourceforge.net/ 

   for repositories of such packages.  For convenience, I have assembled a
   couple of archive files, namely mingw-extra.zip (build-time files:
   headers and import libraries) and misc-dll.zip (runtime files for
   distribution in the gretl package). See

   http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

3. The Inno Setup compiler for making a self-installing executable
   See http://www.jrsoftware.org/

4. The gnuplot for win32 distribution.  
   See http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/winbuild/

B. Modifications to scripts:

1. config.mk: If you're doing a native build, change "BUILDTYPE = cross"
to read "BUILDTYPE = native".  Whichever sort of build you're doing, you
may need to change some of the configuration settings in this file.

2. Makefile: Hopefully you won't need to change anything here.

3. mkwindist: this is a shell script which builds the gretl installer.
You may have to make some changes in the section marked "CONFIGURE HERE", 
near the top of the script.

When you have everything in place you can do "make" to build gretl for
win32, and "make dist" to build the installer executable for gretl.
If all goes well, you should find gretl_install.exe in windist/Output.
