Build gretl.dmg on OS X, the new way using GTK+.framework and
without Fink.  If you do have Fink installed you should probably
disable it while building gretl.  

1. If you don't already have it, you must install the GTK+ Framework
   built by the R guys:

   http://r.research.att.com/gtk2-framework.dmg
   or http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/gtk2-framework.dmg

2. You'll also need some supplementary build tools and auxiliary libraries.
    My copies of these things are at
    
    http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/pub/gretl/osxbuild/local.tar.gz

(Includes libs and headers for readline, fftw3, GMP and MPFR, plus GNU cp, 
wget and automake 1.9.5; some of this you may not need -- but you do need
GNU cp.  You can untar my package in a "safe place" and copy things
into place selectively if you wish.)    

# Or if you prefer to build fftw3 yourself...
# fftw3 version 3.2.1 (install static lib to /usr/local)
wget ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.2.1.tar.gz
tar xvfz fftw-3.2.1.tar.gz
rm fftw-3.2.1.tar.gz
cd fftw-3.2.1
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
# unless you want to use this...
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/fftw-wisdom*

# GMP, MPFR: my local.tar.gz package contains these, but if you prefer
# to build tham yourself, fine.  My versions come from Fink, with
# the install names changed to "/usr/local/lib/..."

make
make install
make osx-dist

# the last target cleans out some unneeded stuff from the distribution dir
# and also attempts to fix library linkage, by calling osx/fixlinks.sh .
# If your "auxiliary" libararies (such as libreadline, libgmp, etc) do not 
# live in /usr/local/lib, set AUXPATH to the right location:

# either just
make osx-dist
# or 
AUXPATH=/some/place/lib make osx-dist

# To save some space in the distribution you can strip the gretl 
# executables and libs, but be careful -- don't destroy needed symbols!
# Notional commands:
cd ~/dist/Gretl.app/Contents/Resources
strip -x lib/whatever
strip -u -r bin/whatever
