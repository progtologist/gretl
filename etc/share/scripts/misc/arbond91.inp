# We first treat all the independent variables as

list X = w w(-1) k ys ys(-1)

# 1-step GMM estimation

dpanel 2 ; n X const --time-dummies --asy --two-step --dpdstyle

# Then we treat the wage and capital stock as predetermined,
# not exogenous.  This gives an approximation to Table 4,
# column c.  But note that some of the data used in that
# model are not available.  In addition, we're using
# finite-sample corrected standard errors.
