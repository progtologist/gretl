c     chkder:
c
c     this subroutine checks the gradients of m nonlinear functions
c     in n variables, evaluated at a point x, for consistency with
c     the functions themselves. the user must call chkder twice,
c     first with mode = 1 and then with mode = 2.
c
c     mode = 1. on input, x must contain the point of evaluation.
c               on output, xp is set to a neighboring point.
c
c     mode = 2. on input, fvec must contain the functions and the
c                         rows of fjac must contain the gradients
c                         of the respective functions each evaluated
c                         at x, and fvecp must contain the functions
c                         evaluated at xp.
c               on output, err contains measures of correctness of
c                          the respective gradients.
c
c     the subroutine does not perform reliably if cancellation or
c     rounding errors cause a severe loss of significance in the
c     evaluation of a function. therefore, none of the components
c     of x should be unusually small (in particular, zero) or any
c     other value which may cause loss of significance.
c
c     the subroutine statement is
c
c       subroutine chkder(m,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,xp,fvecp,mode,err)
c
c     where
c
c       m is a positive integer input variable set to the number
c         of functions.
c
c       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
c         of variables.
c
c       x is an input array of length n.
c
c       fvec is an array of length m. on input when mode = 2,
c         fvec must contain the functions evaluated at x.
c
c       fjac is an m by n array. on input when mode = 2,
c         the rows of fjac must contain the gradients of
c         the respective functions evaluated at x.
c
c       ldfjac is a positive integer input parameter not less than m
c         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.
c
c       xp is an array of length n. on output when mode = 1,
c         xp is set to a neighboring point of x.
c
c       fvecp is an array of length m. on input when mode = 2,
c         fvecp must contain the functions evaluated at xp.
c
c       mode is an integer input variable set to 1 on the first call
c         and 2 on the second. other values of mode are equivalent
c         to mode = 1.
c
c       err is an array of length m. on output when mode = 2,
c         err contains measures of correctness of the respective
c         gradients. if there is no severe loss of significance,
c         then if err(i) is 1.0 the i-th gradient is correct,
c         while if err(i) is 0.0 the i-th gradient is incorrect.
c         for values of err between 0.0 and 1.0, the categorization
c         is less certain. in general, a value of err(i) greater
c         than 0.5 indicates that the i-th gradient is probably
c         correct, while a value of err(i) less than 0.5 indicates
c         that the i-th gradient is probably incorrect.
