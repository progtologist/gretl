c     enorm:
c
c     given an n-vector x, this function calculates the
c     euclidean norm of x.
c
c     the euclidean norm is computed by accumulating the sum of
c     squares in three different sums. the sums of squares for the
c     small and large components are scaled so that no overflows
c     occur. non-destructive underflows are permitted. underflows
c     and overflows do not occur in the computation of the unscaled
c     sum of squares for the intermediate components.
c     the definitions of small, intermediate and large components
c     depend on two constants, rdwarf and rgiant. the main
c     restrictions on these constants are that rdwarf**2 not
c     underflow and rgiant**2 not overflow. the constants
c     given here are suitable for every known computer.
c
c     the function statement is
c
c       double precision function enorm(n,x)
c
c     where
c
c       n is a positive integer input variable.
c
c       x is an input array of length n.
