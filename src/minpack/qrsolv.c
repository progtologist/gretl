c     qrsolv:
c
c     given an m by n matrix a, an n by n diagonal matrix d,
c     and an m-vector b, the problem is to determine an x which
c     solves the system
c
c           a*x = b ,     d*x = 0 ,
c
c     in the least squares sense.
c
c     this subroutine completes the solution of the problem
c     if it is provided with the necessary information from the
c     qr factorization, with column pivoting, of a. that is, if
c     a*p = q*r, where p is a permutation matrix, q has orthogonal
c     columns, and r is an upper triangular matrix with diagonal
c     elements of nonincreasing magnitude, then qrsolv expects
c     the full upper triangle of r, the permutation matrix p,
c     and the first n components of (q transpose)*b. the system
c     a*x = b, d*x = 0, is then equivalent to
c
c                  t       t
c           r*z = q *b ,  p *d*p*z = 0 ,
c
c     where x = p*z. if this system does not have full rank,
c     then a least squares solution is obtained. on output qrsolv
c     also provides an upper triangular matrix s such that
c
c            t   t               t
c           p *(a *a + d*d)*p = s *s .
c
c     s is computed within qrsolv and may be of separate interest.
c
c     the subroutine statement is
c
c       subroutine qrsolv(n,r,ldr,ipvt,diag,qtb,x,sdiag,wa)
c
c     where
c
c       n is a positive integer input variable set to the order of r.
c
c       r is an n by n array. on input the full upper triangle
c         must contain the full upper triangle of the matrix r.
c         on output the full upper triangle is unaltered, and the
c         strict lower triangle contains the strict upper triangle
c         (transposed) of the upper triangular matrix s.
c
c       ldr is a positive integer input variable not less than n
c         which specifies the leading dimension of the array r.
c
c       ipvt is an integer input array of length n which defines the
c         permutation matrix p such that a*p = q*r. column j of p
c         is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix.
c
c       diag is an input array of length n which must contain the
c         diagonal elements of the matrix d.
c
c       qtb is an input array of length n which must contain the first
c         n elements of the vector (q transpose)*b.
c
c       x is an output array of length n which contains the least
c         squares solution of the system a*x = b, d*x = 0.
c
c       sdiag is an output array of length n which contains the
c         diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix s.
c
c       wa is a work array of length n.
