/* 
   This source file based on Minpack: initially converted from 
   fortran using f2c, then rendered into relatively idiomatic
   C with zero-based indexing throughout and pass-by-value for
   parameters that do not function as pointers. We also rely
   on <float.h> for the machine precision rather than Minpack's
   dpmpar().

   Modified in March 2014 by Jack Lucchetti to add a "quality"
   switch (see below).

c     fdjac2:
c
c     this subroutine computes a forward-difference approximation
c     to the m by n jacobian matrix associated with a specified
c     problem of m functions in n variables.
c
c     the subroutine statement is
c
c       subroutine fdjac2(fcn,m,n,x,fvec,fjac,ldfjac,iflag,epsfcn,wa)
c
c     where
c
c       fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
c         calculates the functions. fcn must be declared
c         in an external statement in the user calling
c         program, and should be written as follows.
c
c         subroutine fcn(m,n,x,fvec,iflag)
c         integer m,n,iflag
c         double precision x(n),fvec(m)
c         ----------
c         calculate the functions at x and
c         return this vector in fvec.
c         ----------
c         return
c         end
c
c         the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless
c         the user wants to terminate execution of fdjac2.
c         in this case set iflag to a negative integer.
c
c       m is a positive integer input variable set to the number
c         of functions.
c
c       n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
c         of variables. n must not exceed m.
c
c       quality is a [0-2] int: 0 gives old-style forward-difference,
c         1 bilateral difference and 2 gives 6th order Richardson
c         extrapolation; higher quality means lower speed.
c
c       x is an input array of length n.
c
c       fvec is an input array of length m which must contain the
c         functions evaluated at x.
c
c       fjac is an output m by n array which contains the
c         approximation to the jacobian matrix evaluated at x.
c
c       ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than m
c         which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.
c
c       iflag is an integer variable which can be used to terminate
c         the execution of fdjac2. see description of fcn.
c
c       epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable
c         step length for the forward-difference approximation. this
c         approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
c         functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less
c         than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
c         errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
c         precision.
c
c       wa is a work array of length m.
