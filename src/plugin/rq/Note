The C files in here are f2c translations of the Fortran
sources in version 4.17 of the GNU R quantreg package.

The original author is Roger Koenker; I gather that some 
changes were made for R by Martin Maechler.

I have added a check to rqbr.c to avoid the possibility
of getting stuck in an infinite (or near-infinite) loop
on certain problems.
