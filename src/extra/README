Some examples of use of libgretl via third-party code. You should 
install the gretl library and headers (i.e. "make install" in the 
parent to this directory) before trying to build the examples.

simple_client.c: code for a trivial illustrative client program for
libgretl.  By looking at this code you should be able to get the basic
idea of how to send information to libgretl, and how one might deal with
the struct that libgretl returns.

arma_example.c: example of opening a dataset (a .gdt file supplied
with the gretl distribution) and estimating an ARMA model.

nls_example.c: example of estimation of a nonlinear model via
nonlinear least squares.
