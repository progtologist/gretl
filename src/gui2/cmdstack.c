/* This module contains apparatus for handling a log of commands
   generated via point-and-click, or via the GUI console.  If
   the user is working in the context of a saved session file, the
   log goes to "session.inp" inside the session directory,
   otherwise it goes to a temporary file in the user's personal
   "dotdir".

   The command log may well be unusable as a script without
   modification, due to possible "nonlinearities" in the GUI (e.g.
   having several model windows open at once and performing
   tests on the models out of the order of estimation), but
   nonetheless it may be useful as a record and for pedagogical
   purposes.

   We flag errors via the GUI only in response to specific requests
   to view or update the log.
